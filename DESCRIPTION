Title: Learn Computer and Data Science using Algorithmic Trading
Version: 0.4.4
Author: Vladimir Zhbanko
Maintainer: Vladimir Zhbanko <vladimir.zhbanko@gmail.com>
Description: Provide sets of functions and methods to learn and practice data science using idea of algorithmic trading.
    Main goal is to process information within "Decision Support System" to come up with analysis or predictions.
    There are several utilities such as dynamic and adaptive risk management using reinforcement learning
    and even functions to generate predictions of price changes using pattern recognition deep regression learning.
